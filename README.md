# Online Aggregation of Probability Forecasts with Confidence (APFC)

This repository contains code for paper Online Aggregation of Probability Forecasts with Confidence.

We use implementation details described in the paper.

## Implementation of the method

Folders "synthetic_data_exp" and "real_data_exp" contains the Matlab code scripts required to execute the method of Online Aggregation of Probability Forecasts.

## Data

We use publicly available dataset used in GEFCom2014
Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 dataset (Load treck).

We save the data in .mat files that contain a structures with following fields:

Hourly load time series

Temperature time series

Date and hour or timestamp when the load is measured

Table of synchronized calendar parameters (seasons, days of week, parts of day)
